What does it do?

# Implementation

Nuxt 3
Vuetify 3
Laravel

Would prefer to have generics for arrays

Preferred to use JSON to store data that could be denormalized, would greatly increase complexity to normalize
There is no reason to look up the data that is stored as JSON

Moving things to Actions for testing

Domains to separate code from mixing

Attempt to prevent the mixing of dependency code to application logic

# Improvements
The NodeJS server is slow
    Currently runs inside the same docker container for simplicity, might be faster if runs outside
    Error handling on server
Better error handling
- Tokenizer server 
- Using objects instead of arrays for senses, words, readings but no generics
- API isn't documented
